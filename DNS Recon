DNSRecon is another great script that can help you discover DNS data from any given domain name.

It allows you to enumerate all types of DNS records, including A, AAAA, SPF, TXT, SOA, NS and MX, 
and also includes a brute force technique for grabbing subdomain and host A and AAAA records based on a wordlist.

A cool thing we noticed is that it supports checking for cached A and AAAA DNS records on the DNS servers, as well as local DNS enumeration capabilities.

How can I perform DNS exploration with DNSRecon?

The easiest way is by using the -d parameter, as you see below:

dnsrecon -d domain.com

Here we performed this dns enumeration against linkedin.com, and this was the result:

As shown, it was able not only to fetch multiple records (MX, A, AAAA, TXT, SRV and NS), but also to find some exposed bind versions from their DNS servers.
