Fierce
Fierce is another great DNS reconnaissance tool. 
Written in Perl, Fierce offers numerous options for performing DNS enumeration by scanning domains in just minutes. 
Its syntax is pretty easy, as you can see:

fierce -dns securitytrails.com
Expected output:

root@securitytrails-kali:~# fierce -dns securitytrails.com
DNS Servers for securitytrails.com:
ns08.domaincontrol.com
ns07.domaincontrol.com
Trying zone transfer first...
Testing ns08.domaincontrol.com
Request timed out or transfer not allowed.
Testing ns07.domaincontrol.com
Request timed out or transfer not allowed.
Unsuccessful in zone transfer (it was worth a shot)
Okay, trying the good old fashioned way... brute force
Checking for wildcard DNS...
Nope. Good.
Now performing 2280 test(s)...
151.139.243.5 blog.securitytrails.com
151.139.243.5 ftp.securitytrails.com
Subnets found (may want to probe here using nmap or unicornscan):
151.139.243.0-255 : 2 hostnames found.
Done with Fierce scan: http://ha.ckers.org/fierce/
Found 2 entries.
Have a nice day.

Fierce was able to discover a few subdomains, along with NS records, and attempted to run a DNS transfer, which obviously failed.

By adding the â€“wide, you can also extend the fierce scan to the entire class C after finding any matching hostnames in that class C. 
This can take a lot of time to finish, especially on networks with a lot of hosts, so keep that in mind.
