Nmap was our #1 choice when we reviewed the best port scanners, but it’s really more than that. This time it will help us reveal DNS information from a remote domain name.

By using the dns-brute script, Nmap will attempt to enumerate DNS hostnames by brute forcing popular subdomain names. 
In this case, we did it against microsoft.com and this was the result:

[root@research ~]# nmap -T4 -p 53 --script dns-brute microsoft.com
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-10-02 11:56 -03

While this isn’t the most complete DNS recon option, it does help as an alternative source of information during your data collection process.
