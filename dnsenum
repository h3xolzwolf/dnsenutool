DNSenum
DNSEnum is a great script specifically designed for DNS recon activities. Written in Perl, 
it can help you create a full DNS map of any domain name on the Internet.

Available in most distros, including Ubuntu, Fedora, and of course, Kali Linux, it offers an easy syntax for all who are performing reconnaissance tasks.

What can I do with DNSenum?
Fetch NS, MX, AXFR and A records, as well as remote BIND version from the DNS server. Apart from that, 
it also allows you to perform Google scraping using Google dorks such as all 
inurl: -www site:domain, launch brute force subdomain reconnaissance attacks using word lists, and get a full list of C class domain network ranges. 
It also allows WHOIS queries on each one of them and reverse DNS lookups against netranges.

How does it work?

Let’s look at an example where we’ll be avoiding reverse lookup (–noreverse) and saving the output into a file.xml (-o) while querying securitytrails.com:

[root@research ~]# dnsenum --noreverse -o file.xml securitytrails.com
